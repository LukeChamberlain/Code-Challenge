# Code-Challenge
The correct letter that the user is attempting to guess is just written below that way you can tell if it is working correctly and the right letters are appearing when and where they are supposed to,
I know theinstructions didn't say to include that but I thought it would be helpful to whoever reviews this that way they can verify that it is working correctly.
